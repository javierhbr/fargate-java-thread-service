    # Increased timeout for large file testing
    # Default (300s = 5 min) is sufficient for small files (< 100MB)
    # For GB-size files with throttling, increase accordingly:
    #   - 1GB @ 1MB/s: ~1000s (~17 min)
    #   - 5GB @ 512KB/s: ~10000s (~2.8 hours)
    timeout-seconds: 1200  # 20 minutes - suitable for up to 1GB files at normal speed
